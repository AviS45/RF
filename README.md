Here is the code for Rf communication using msp430. I am using em430f5137 board with cc1101 RF chip onboard.
Look for the branches for programs.
I have done 2 experiments with the RF Development tools.
once a simple Transmitter program i.e rf-TX and the corresponding receiver program rf-TX.
The third is a program where the tool act as both transmitter as well as receiver, so both the development tool will have Same program. But the address is to be change accordingly
